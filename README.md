# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-IRIS-Dataset

EDA is the task of analyzing data from statistics, simple plotting tools, linear algebra and other techniques to understand what the dataset is, before we build actual machine learning model.

The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
